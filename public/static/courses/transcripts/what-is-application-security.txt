Welcome to the first topic of our course on Application Security! In this session, we’ll dive into the basics of application security, its significance, and key concepts. 
Let’s begin by answering the question: What is Application Security?

It involves identifying, addressing, and preventing vulnerabilities to ensure that applications remain secure against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats.

In the next topic, we’ll explore why application security is so important and how it impacts the safety and reliability of modern software systems.
