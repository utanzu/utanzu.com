The Principle of Least Privilege is an important concept in application security. It means giving users or systems only the access they need to do their job - no more, no less. This helps protect sensitive information and reduces security risks.

For example, a junior employee might need access to specific files but shouldn’t be able to edit sensitive databases. On the other hand, a database administrator may need special access to manage databases but doesn’t need to view payroll information.

By following this principle, we limit the damage that can happen if someone makes a mistake or if their account is hacked. It also reduces the chances of unauthorized access to sensitive systems.

In our next session, we’ll look at 'Secure by Design' and how it makes security a priority right from the start. 

Let's meet there!
