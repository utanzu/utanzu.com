MFA enhances security by requiring multiple forms of verification.

### Methods:

- `Something you know`: Password or PIN.
- `Something you have`: Authentication app or hardware token.
- `Something you are`: Biometric verification (e.g., fingerprint).

### Benefits:

- Reduces the risk of unauthorized access from stolen credentials.
- Enhances overall security posture.

#### Key Points:

- Encourage users to enable MFA for critical accounts.
- Provide backup options (e.g., recovery codes) for accessibility.
- Regularly update MFA implementations to address evolving threats.
