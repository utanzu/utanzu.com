An API (Application Programming Interface) allows applications to communicate with each other. APIs enable software functionality to be shared securely.

## Key Points:

- APIs use protocols like REST, GraphQL, or SOAP.
- They expose specific endpoints for external or internal usage.

### Common Use Cases:

- Integrating third-party services (e.g., payment gateways).
- Enabling mobile apps to communicate with servers.

Securing APIs ensures that sensitive data and services are not exposed to unauthorized users.
