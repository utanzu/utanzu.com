Authentication ensures that the right users can access your API, while authorization defines what they can do once authenticated.

## Common Methods:

- **API Keys**: Basic token-based access control.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Advanced mechanism for secure delegated access.
- **JWT**: Compact tokens used for stateless authentication.

### Best Practices:

- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Implement least privilege access controls.
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets.

Proper authentication and authorization protect APIs from abuse.
