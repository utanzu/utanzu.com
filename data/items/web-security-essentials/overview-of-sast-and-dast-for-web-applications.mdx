SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) are essential techniques for identifying vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Key Differences:
- **SAST**: Scans source code to detect vulnerabilities before the application is deployed.
- **DAST**: Simulates real-world attacks by testing applications during runtime.

### Benefits of SAST:
- Early detection of vulnerabilities during development.
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines.

### Benefits of DAST:
- Identifies runtime vulnerabilities like injection flaws.
- Does not require access to source code.

By combining SAST and DAST, developers can achieve comprehensive security coverage.
