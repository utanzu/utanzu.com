Cookies, sessions, and authentication are key concepts in web application security.

### Cookies:

- Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's browser by websites.
- They are used to maintain user preferences, track sessions, and manage authentication.
- Cookies can be secured using attributes like `HttpOnly` and `Secure` to prevent unauthorized access.

### Sessions:

- Sessions allow the server to remember user information across multiple requests.
- Typically, a session ID is stored in a cookie, linking the user to their data on the server.

### Authentication:

- Authentication verifies the identity of a user or system.
- Methods include passwords, tokens, or biometrics.

#### Key Points:

- Use `HttpOnly` cookies to prevent JavaScript access.
- Implement secure session handling to avoid hijacking.
- Ensure strong authentication mechanisms to protect user data.
