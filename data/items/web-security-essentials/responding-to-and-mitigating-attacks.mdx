When a web application comes under attack, a structured response can minimize damage and restore operations quickly. Responding to incidents effectively is a critical part of maintaining application security.

## Steps to Respond:

1. **Identify the Attack**: Use monitoring tools to pinpoint the type of attack and affected areas.
2. **Isolate the Threat**: Limit the attack's scope by disconnecting affected systems from the network.
3. **Implement Mitigations**: Apply patches, update configurations, or block malicious IPs.

### Key Mitigation Strategies:

- Use a WAF to block malicious traffic.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
- Regularly test and update incident response plans.

Effective incident response ensures quick recovery and limits the impact on your organization.
