Data at rest refers to information stored on devices such as servers or databases. Encrypting this data adds a critical layer of protection in case of physical theft or unauthorized system access. Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography algorithms help ensure that sensitive information is only accessible with the correct keys.

## Encryption Methods

- **Full-Disk Encryption**: Protects entire drives at the OS level.
- **File-Level Encryption**: Secures specific files or directories.
- **Database Encryption**: Uses features like Transparent Data Encryption.

It is important to securely manage encryption keys and rotate them regularly. By implementing robust encryption, you minimize damage in the event of a data breach.
