  title="What Makes Web Applications Vulnerable?"
  summary="Understanding what makes web applications vulnerable is the first step in protecting them. By identifying and addressing these weaknesses, developers and organizations can reduce the risks of attacks and improve application security."

Web applications are vulnerable due to various factors that can be exploited by attackers. These vulnerabilities often arise from flaws in design, development, deployment, or configuration.

### Common Causes of Vulnerabilities:

- **`Code Insecurity`**: Poor coding practices, such as not validating user input, can lead to issues like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **`Misconfiguration`**: Weak server configurations, like leaving default settings or exposing sensitive files, create easy entry points for attackers.
- **`Outdated Software`**: Using outdated frameworks, libraries, or tools can expose applications to known vulnerabilities.
- **`Weak Authentication`**: Insufficient password policies or improperly implemented authentication mechanisms make it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

### Summary:

- Web applications can be compromised due to insecure code, which attackers exploit to execute malicious actions.
- Misconfigured servers and environments expose sensitive data and make applications easier to breach.
- Using outdated software increases the risk of attackers exploiting known security flaws.
- Weak authentication and access controls can allow unauthorized users to access sensitive resources.
