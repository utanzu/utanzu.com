APIs are susceptible to specific types of attacks, such as Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) and excessive data exposure.

## Common Attack Types:

- **BOLA**: Unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- **Excessive Data Exposure**: APIs returning unnecessary information.

### Prevention Strategies:

- Enforce strict access controls on all API endpoints.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs.
- Use monitoring tools to detect abnormal API usage.

Preventing API attacks is crucial to safeguard sensitive data and resources.
