Broken authentication and authorization vulnerabilities allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or exploit other implementation flaws.

### Common Issues:

- **Session Hijacking**: Exploiting valid session tokens.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Using breached username/password combinations.
- **Unprotected Endpoints**: Allowing unauthorized access.

### Mitigation Techniques:

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an additional layer of security.
- **Session Management**: Use secure, expiring session tokens.
- **Password Policies**: Enforce strong, unique passwords.

Protecting authentication mechanisms is essential to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.
