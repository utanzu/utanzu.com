Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others.

### Types of XSS:

- **Stored XSS**: Malicious script is permanently stored on the target server.
- **Reflected XSS**: Script is reflected off a web server, such as in an error message or search result.
- **DOM-Based XSS**: Vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side.

### Detection and Mitigation:

- **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized.
- **Output Encoding**: Encode data before rendering it on the web page.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP to restrict sources from which scripts can be executed.

Regularly testing applications for XSS vulnerabilities and applying these mitigation strategies can significantly enhance security.
