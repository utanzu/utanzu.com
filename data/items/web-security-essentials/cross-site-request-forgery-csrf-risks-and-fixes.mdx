CSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It exploits the trust that a web application has in the user's browser.

### Risks:

- **Unauthorized Actions**: Perform actions on behalf of authenticated users without their consent.
- **Data Modification**: Change user settings or data.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Perform actions with the user's privileges.

### Fixes:

- **Anti-CSRF Tokens**: Implement tokens that are unique to each session and included in requests.
- **SameSite Cookie Attribute**: Use this attribute to prevent browsers from sending cookies along with cross-site requests.
- **Re-authentication**: Require users to re-authenticate before performing sensitive actions.

By applying these fixes, applications can defend against CSRF attacks.
