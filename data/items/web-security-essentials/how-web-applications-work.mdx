Web applications function by connecting three core components: the frontend, backend, and databases. These components work together to deliver dynamic and interactive web experiences.

### Key Components:

- **Frontend**: This is what the user interacts with, including the design and functionality seen in a web browser. It is built using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend**: The backend handles the logic, processes user requests, and communicates with the database. It is built using server-side programming languages like Node.js, Python, or PHP.
- **Database**: Databases store and manage application data, such as user profiles, content, and settings. Examples include MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

### Summary:

- The frontend serves as the visual layer of a web application, handling user interaction and presentation.
- The backend processes data, executes application logic, and acts as a bridge between the frontend and database.
- Databases ensure data is stored, retrieved, and managed efficiently.
- All three components must work seamlessly to create a functional web application.

By understanding these components, you'll gain insight into how web applications deliver services to users and identify potential points of vulnerability in their architecture.
