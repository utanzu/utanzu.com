  title="Limitations and Best Practices for WAF Usage"
  summary="Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are powerful tools for defending against web application threats, but they are not a standalone solution. Understanding their limitations and implementing best practices enhances their effectiveness."
/>

## Limitations of WAFs:

- **Cannot Fix Vulnerable Code**: A WAF can mitigate threats but does not address root causes.
- **False Positives and Negatives**: Legitimate requests might be blocked, or some attacks may bypass detection.
- **Performance Impact**: Increased latency when processing traffic.

## Best Practices for WAF Usage:

1. **Keep Rules Updated**: Regularly update WAF rules to address emerging threats.
2. **Combine with Secure Coding**: Use WAFs as part of a multi-layered security approach.
3. **Monitor Logs**: Analyze WAF logs to identify suspicious patterns and improve configurations.

A WAF works best as part of a comprehensive security strategy rather than a single defense mechanism.
