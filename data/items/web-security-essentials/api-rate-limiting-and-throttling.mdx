Rate limiting and throttling control the number of requests a user or application can make to an API, preventing abuse.

## Key Concepts:

- **Rate Limiting**: Sets a maximum number of requests allowed per time frame.
- **Throttling**: Slows down users exceeding the limit without completely blocking them.

### Benefits:

- Prevents denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- Ensures fair usage of resources.

Implement rate limiting to maintain API availability and reliability.
