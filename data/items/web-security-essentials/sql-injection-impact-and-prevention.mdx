SQL Injection is a code injection technique that allows attackers to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database.

### Impact:

- **Unauthorized Data Access**: Attackers can retrieve, modify, or delete data.
- **Authentication Bypass**: Gain unauthorized access to systems.
- **Data Corruption**: Alter or delete data, leading to data integrity issues.

### Prevention:

- **Use Prepared Statements**: Ensure that SQL queries are predefined and parameterized.
- **Input Validation**: Rigorously validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Limit database user permissions to the minimum necessary.

Implementing these practices helps protect applications from SQL Injection attacks.
