Session management is essential for maintaining secure user interactions.

### Key Practices:

- Use unique session IDs for each session.
- Store session IDs securely in `HttpOnly` cookies.
- Implement session timeouts to minimize risks from inactive sessions.

### Additional Tips:

- Regularly regenerate session IDs to prevent fixation attacks.
- Use secure connections (HTTPS) to protect session data in transit.

#### Key Points:

- Avoid exposing session IDs in URLs.
- Monitor and log session activity for unusual behavior.
- Securely invalidate sessions on user logout or inactivity.
