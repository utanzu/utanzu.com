Security misconfigurations occur when systems or applications are set up incorrectly, leaving gaps for attackers to exploit. This can include default passwords, open database ports, or verbose error messages. Failing to address these issues often leads to unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Common Examples

- Failure to patch or update software.
- Exposed admin interfaces accessible to the public internet.
- Misconfigured security headers or server settings.

### Consequences

If attackers discover these gaps, they can escalate privileges, compromise sensitive information, or deface websites. Consistent reviews and audits of configurations can mitigate these risks. Always follow secure-by-default practices to minimize exposure.
