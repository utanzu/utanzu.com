Input validation is the process of verifying user input before processing or storing it. It helps maintain data integrity and protects the application from malicious inputs. By checking the format, type, and length of incoming data, you reduce the risk of vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

## Key Points

- Helps prevent unexpected or dangerous data from entering the system.
- Reduces the likelihood of data corruption or injection attacks.
- Ensures application logic and security remain intact.

Keeping validation rules updated and robust is essential for safeguarding your application. Always validate input server-side even if you have client-side checks in place.
