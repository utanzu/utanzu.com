The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a framework that outlines the stages of software development. Incorporating security into SDLC ensures secure applications from the ground up.

## Stages of SDLC:

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Define security requirements alongside functional needs.
2. **Design**: Identify potential threats through threat modeling.
3. **Implementation**: Write secure code and conduct regular code reviews.
4. **Testing**: Perform security testing, including SAST and DAST.
5. **Deployment**: Secure deployment environments and configurations.

By integrating security at every stage, SDLC reduces vulnerabilities and ensures robust applications.
