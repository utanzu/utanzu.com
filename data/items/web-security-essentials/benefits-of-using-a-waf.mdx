A Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides several benefits, ensuring your web application remains secure against evolving threats.

## Key Benefits:

- **Real-Time Protection**: Blocks malicious requests before they reach the application.
- **Compliance Assistance**: Helps meet security standards such as PCI-DSS by protecting sensitive data.
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable rules to address specific vulnerabilities.

### Additional Advantages:

- **DDoS Mitigation**: Filters large volumes of traffic during attacks.
- **Improved User Experience**: Maintains application availability by blocking only malicious requests.

By leveraging a WAF, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of cyberattacks while maintaining compliance and performance.
