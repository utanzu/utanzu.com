HTTPS and TLS ensure that data transmitted between a client and server remains confidential and tamper-proof. By encrypting traffic, attackers cannot easily intercept or modify sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. Using modern TLS configurations is essential to avoid weak cipher suites.

## Best Practices

- **Enforce HTTPS**: Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- **Use Strong Ciphers**: Disable outdated protocols like SSLv3.
- **Implement HSTS**: Prevent accidental HTTP connections.

Regularly review SSL/TLS certificates to ensure they are valid and secure. Keeping your encryption updated prevents eavesdroppers from exploiting outdated methods.
