Agile development prioritizes iterative progress, but incorporating security is essential for delivering secure software.

## Tips for Secure Agile Development:

- **Security as a Sprint Goal**: Include security tasks in each sprint.
- **Continuous Testing**: Use automated tools to run SAST and DAST regularly.
- **Team Training**: Ensure developers are trained in secure coding practices.

### Benefits:

- Faster identification and resolution of security issues.
- Enhanced collaboration between security and development teams.

Embedding security into Agile ensures that it becomes part of the development process, not an afterthought.
