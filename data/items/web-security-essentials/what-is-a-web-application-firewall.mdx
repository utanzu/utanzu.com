A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security solution that monitors and filters HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet. Its main purpose is to protect web applications from common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

### Features of a WAF:

- Analyzes HTTP traffic to identify malicious patterns.
- Provides customizable rules to fit specific security needs.
- Blocks traffic from suspicious IP addresses.

### Types of WAFs:

1. **Network-based WAFs**: Installed at the network perimeter for fast protection.
2. **Host-based WAFs**: Integrated with the application, offering deep insights but requiring system resources.
3. **Cloud-based WAFs**: Easy to deploy and scale, managed by third-party providers.

Using a WAF enhances security by blocking many attack vectors before they reach the application.
