Injection attacks occur when untrusted input is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. Common examples include SQL, OS command, or LDAP injection. Attackers can manipulate queries and access restricted data or execute unauthorized commands.

## Key Defense Strategies

1. **Use Prepared Statements**: Bind variables within queries.
2. **Parameterize Queries**: Separate query logic from user-supplied data.
3. **Escape Dangerous Characters**: Convert special characters to safe forms.

### Final Thoughts

Staying vigilant about the data flowing into your application is crucial. By combining parameterization, escaping, and rigorous validation, you can significantly lower the threat of injection attacks.
