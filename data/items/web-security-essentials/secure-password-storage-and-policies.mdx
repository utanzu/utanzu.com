Passwords are a common authentication method, and their secure storage is vital.

### Best Practices:

- Always hash passwords before storing them in a database.
- Use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
- Never store plain-text passwords.

### Password Policies:

- Enforce minimum length and complexity requirements.
- Require periodic password changes to enhance security.
- Educate users about avoiding weak or reused passwords.

#### Key Points:

- Never use outdated or insecure hashing algorithms like MD5.
- Use password salting to protect against rainbow table attacks.
- Encourage the use of password managers for better security.
