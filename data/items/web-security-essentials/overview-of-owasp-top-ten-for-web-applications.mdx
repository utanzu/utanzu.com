The OWASP Top Ten is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

### Key Risks:

- **Injection Attacks**: Occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
- **Broken Authentication**: Involves compromising passwords, keys, or session tokens to assume other users' identities.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Happens when applications do not adequately protect sensitive information.

Understanding these risks is crucial for developing secure web applications. Regularly reviewing and updating security practices in line with the OWASP Top Ten can help mitigate common vulnerabilities.
