This quiz consists of **10 multiple-choice questions** to test your understanding of key concepts covered in this course.

#### **1. A web application allows users to log in using their username and password. However, users report that their accounts are being accessed without their knowledge. What is the most likely reason for this security issue?**

A) The application does not enforce password complexity requirements.  
B) The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection.  
C) The application is not implementing proper session management techniques.  
D) The application is using HTTPS for login pages.

#### **2. Which of the following HTTP methods should be restricted or disabled to improve security in web applications?**

A) GET and POST  
B) PUT and DELETE  
C) HEAD and OPTIONS  
D) TRACE and CONNECT

#### **3. A web application stores user credentials using MD5 hashing. Why is this a security risk?**

A) MD5 hashing increases the load on the database server.  
B) MD5 hashing is reversible, making it easy for attackers to retrieve passwords.  
C) MD5 hashing is deprecated and prone to brute-force attacks.  
D) MD5 hashing is too complex to implement correctly.

#### **4. A developer wants to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in a web application. Which of the following is the most effective way to mitigate this risk?**

A) Using TLS encryption for data transmission.  
B) Encoding and sanitizing user input before rendering it in a web page.  
C) Restricting API access to trusted clients only.  
D) Implementing two-factor authentication (2FA).

#### **5. A security analyst is testing a login form for vulnerabilities. They enter the following string into the password field: `' OR '1'='1`. What type of attack is this?**

A) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
B) SQL Injection  
C) Command Injection  
D) Remote Code Execution (RCE)

#### **6. A web application uses session cookies for authentication. Which of the following is a best practice for securing session cookies?**

A) Storing the session ID in local storage for easy access.  
B) Setting the HttpOnly and Secure attributes on cookies.  
C) Allowing session IDs to be passed in the URL.  
D) Using the same session ID across multiple user logins.

#### **7. A company is designing an API for their web application. Which of the following security measures should be implemented to protect against API-specific attacks?**

A) Disabling HTTPS to reduce processing overhead.  
B) Implementing rate limiting and throttling mechanisms.  
C) Allowing unrestricted API access for faster performance.  
D) Storing API keys in client-side JavaScript for easier access.

#### **8. A user receives an email claiming to be from their bank, asking them to log in via a link that leads to a fake website. This is an example of what type of attack?**

A) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
B) Phishing  
C) Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack  
D) DNS Spoofing

#### **9. During a security audit, an application is found to expose detailed error messages containing database query details. Why is this a security concern?**

A) Attackers can use error messages to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection.  
B) Error messages help users troubleshoot login issues.  
C) Detailed error messages improve the user experience.  
D) The error messages do not affect security at all.

#### **10. A web application firewall (WAF) is being deployed to protect against web-based attacks. What type of threats does a WAF primarily mitigate?**

A) Network-layer attacks like DDoS.  
B) Malware infections on client devices.  
C) Application-layer attacks like SQL Injection and XSS.  
D) Insider threats from malicious employees.
