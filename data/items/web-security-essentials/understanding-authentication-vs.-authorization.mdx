Authentication and authorization are often confused but serve different purposes in web security.

### Authentication:

- Focuses on verifying the user's identity (e.g., login credentials).
- Methods include passwords, biometric scans, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### Authorization:

- Determines what resources an authenticated user can access.
- Example: An admin can access all features, while regular users have limited access.

#### Key Points:

- Implement least privilege principles for authorization.
- Ensure authentication mechanisms are robust and secure.
- Separate authentication and authorization logic for clarity and security.
