You’ve passed the security checkpoint at the secret facility—now what? Just because you **proved your identity (authentication)** doesn’t mean you can **go anywhere**. There are still **restricted areas** where only certain people are allowed. This is **authorization** in action—it determines **what a user is allowed to do**.

### What is Authorization?

**Authorization** is the process of granting or denying access to resources **based on user roles, permissions, and policies**.

### Common Authorization Techniques

#### **1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Users are **assigned roles**, and each role has specific permissions.
- Common in **corporate and enterprise systems**.

**Example:**  
In a hospital system:

- **Doctors** can view and update patient records.
- **Nurses** can view records but not edit them.
- **Receptionists** can schedule appointments but not access medical data.
