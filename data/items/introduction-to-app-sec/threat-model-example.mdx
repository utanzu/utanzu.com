Threat modeling helps identify security risks in applications before they can be exploited. It is a structured process that analyzes an application's security threats and designs measures to reduce them.

### Approaches to Threat Modeling

Several frameworks exist for threat modeling, including:

1. **STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)** - Developed by Microsoft.
2. **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)** - Risk-centric approach.
3. **VAST (Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat Modeling)** - Scalable for enterprise systems.
4. **Trike** - Security auditing framework with risk assessment.

For this example, we will use the **STRIDE model**, as it is beginner-friendly and widely used in application security.

### Sample Application: Online Banking System

Imagine we are securing an **Online Banking Web Application** that allows users to:

- Log in securely.
- Transfer money to other accounts.
- View account statements.

#### **Step 1: Identify System Components**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Web Application | The online banking website. |
| Database | Stores user data, accounts, and transactions. |
| Authentication System | Handles user login and access control. |
| API | Connects frontend with the backend database. |

#### **Step 2: Identify Possible Threats Using STRIDE**

| STRIDE Threat | Example in Banking Application | Possible Consequences | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Spoofing** (Impersonation) | Attacker pretends to be a bank customer. | Unauthorized transactions. | Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). |
| **Tampering** (Data Modification) | Modifying transaction details in transit. | Fraudulent transactions. | Use end-to-end encryption (TLS 1.2+). |
| **Repudiation** (Denying Actions) | A customer denies making a transaction. | Disputes and financial loss. | Implement logging and digital signatures. |
| **Information Disclosure** (Data Leakage) | Exposing account details due to weak access controls. | Identity theft and fraud. | Use strong access controls and data encryption. |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)** | Attacker floods the server with requests. | Service unavailability. | Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection. |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | A user gains admin privileges through a flaw. | Full control over the system. | Enforce role-based access control (RBAC). |

#### **Step 3: Create a Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**

A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** helps visualize how data moves through the system and where threats might exist.

**Example DFD for Online Banking System:**

```plaintext
[User] → [Login Page] → [Authentication System] → [Database]
[User] → [Transaction Page] → [API] → [Database]
```

- The **Login Page** interacts with the **Authentication System** to validate user credentials.
- The **Transaction Page** interacts with the **API** to request money transfers.
- The **Database** stores all user information securely.

#### **Step 4: Implement Security Controls**

After identifying threats, the next step is applying security controls to mitigate them.

| Security Control | Protection Against | Implementation |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | Spoofing | Require users to enter a one-time code. |
| TLS Encryption | Tampering, Information Disclosure | Encrypt all sensitive data in transit. |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | Elevation of Privilege | Restrict user permissions based on roles. |
| Web Application Firewall (WAF) | Denial of Service | Detect and block malicious traffic. |

#### **Step 5: Review and Improve**

Threat modeling is an **ongoing process**. Regular security audits, penetration testing, and continuous monitoring should be performed to detect new threats.
