Imagine leaving your house with all the doors open and no locks. That’s what an **unhardened system** is like—an easy target for attackers. **System hardening** is the process of reducing vulnerabilities in an application, operating system, or network.

### Why System Hardening is Important

- **Reduces Attack Surfaces**: Removes unnecessary services and features.
- **Prevents Exploits**: Eliminates known vulnerabilities.
- **Enhances Compliance**: Meets industry standards like CIS, NIST, and ISO 27001.

### Key Steps in System Hardening

#### **1. Remove Unnecessary Services and Software**

- Disable **unused ports, services, and applications**.
- Uninstall **default applications** that are not required.

```shell
# Check running services (Linux)
systemctl list-units --type=service

# Disable an unnecessary service
sudo systemctl disable cups.service
```

#### **2. Apply Security Patches and Updates**

- Enable **automatic security updates**.
- Use a **patch management system** to track missing patches.

```shell
# Ubuntu: Update and upgrade system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

#### **3. Implement Least Privilege Access**

- Restrict **admin privileges**.
- Use **role-based access control (RBAC)** to manage permissions.

```shell
# Linux: Restrict user privileges
usermod -L user_name  # Lock user account
chmod 750 /var/www/html  # Limit access to web directory
```

#### **4. Disable Unused Network Protocols**

- Disable **Telnet, FTP, and SMBv1** if not in use.
- Use **SSH instead of Telnet** for remote access.

```shell
# Disable Telnet service (Linux)
sudo systemctl disable telnet.socket
```

System hardening **reduces the attack surface**, making it harder for attackers to exploit weaknesses.
