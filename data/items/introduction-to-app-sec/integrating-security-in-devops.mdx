DevSecOps is the practice of **integrating security into every phase** of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), rather than treating it as an afterthought. This approach ensures that applications are **secure by design** and not just secured after deployment.

### Why Security Needs to Be Part of DevOps

- **Early detection of vulnerabilities** reduces security risks.
- **Automated security checks** ensure compliance without slowing development.
- **Continuous security monitoring** helps detect and respond to threats.

### The DevSecOps Workflow

| DevOps Phase | Security Integration                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plan**     | Define security requirements and threat models.             |
| **Develop**  | Implement secure coding practices and static code analysis. |
| **Build**    | Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities (SCA).                |
| **Test**     | Conduct automated security testing (SAST, DAST).            |
| **Release**  | Implement security policies for deployment.                 |
| **Monitor**  | Continuously detect threats and misconfigurations.          |

#### Example: Secure Code Review in DevSecOps

```shell
# Run a static analysis scan with SonarQube
sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=my_project -Dsonar.sources=src
```

Integrating security into DevOps enables **faster, more secure software delivery**, ensuring that vulnerabilities are addressed **before deployment**.
