Have you ever used spell check before submitting an essay? **Static Analysis Tools** act like spell check for your code, identifying potential security flaws before execution.

### What is Static Analysis?

**`Static Application Security Testing` (SAST)** is an automated method to analyze source code for security vulnerabilities **without running the application**.

### Benefits of Static Analysis

- **Early Detection**: Identifies vulnerabilities in the development phase.
- **Faster Fixes**: Finds issues before deployment.
- **Automated Security Checks**: Reduces human error.

### Popular Static Analysis Tools

| Tool          | Language Support               | Key Features                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **SonarQube** | Java, JavaScript, Python, etc. | Code quality and security analysis.             |
| **Bandit**    | Python                         | Detects common security issues in Python code.  |
| **Brakeman**  | Ruby on Rails                  | Scans for vulnerabilities in Ruby applications. |
| **Checkmarx** | Multiple Languages             | Enterprise-grade SAST solution.                 |

### Example: Running Static Analysis with SonarQube

```bash
# Scan Java project with SonarQube
sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=my_project -Dsonar.sources=src
```

The tool will identify vulnerabilities like **hardcoded passwords**, **insecure API calls**, and **poor error handling**.

### Best Practices for Using Static Analysis

1. **Integrate SAST in CI/CD pipelines** for continuous scanning.
2. **Use multiple tools** to increase detection accuracy.
3. **Regularly update scanning rules** to catch new vulnerabilities.
