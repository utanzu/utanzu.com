## What are Web Applications?

Web applications are programs or services that run on a web server and are accessed through a web browser. Unlike traditional software installed on individual computers, web applications are designed to be accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

## Key Characteristics of Web Applications:

- **Frontend and Backend**: A web application consists of a client-side interface (frontend) for user interaction and a server-side component (backend) for processing requests and managing data.
- **Internet-Dependent**: Internet access is essential for web applications to function since resources are hosted on a server.
- **Scalability**: They are designed to handle multiple users simultaneously, making them ideal for modern businesses and global accessibility.

## Why Understanding Web Applications is Critical for Security:

Understanding the structure and functionality of web applications is crucial for identifying and mitigating potential security risks. A solid grasp of their architecture helps uncover weak points such as:

- Insecure communication channels.
- Weak authentication mechanisms.
- Poorly designed APIs.

By learning how web applications operate, youâ€™ll better understand why they are such prominent targets for attackers and how to defend against potential threats.
