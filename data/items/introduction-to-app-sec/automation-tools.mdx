Security automation is a key principle of DevSecOps. By integrating automated security tools into the CI/CD pipeline, organizations can identify vulnerabilities and enforce security policies **without manual intervention**.

### Types of Security Automation Tools

| Tool Category                             | Purpose                                              | Example Tools                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Static Analysis (SAST)**                | Scan source code for vulnerabilities                 | SonarQube, Snyk                      |
| **Dynamic Analysis (DAST)**               | Test running applications for security flaws         | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite                |
| **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**   | Detect vulnerabilities in dependencies               | Snyk, Dependabot                     |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security** | Scan Terraform, Kubernetes, and cloud configurations | Checkov, KICS                        |
| **Secrets Management**                    | Prevent hardcoded credentials                        | HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager |

#### Example: Automating Security in CI/CD with GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on: push

jobs:
  sast_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Snyk SAST Scan
        run: snyk test --all-projects
```

Automating security reduces human error and ensures **consistent security enforcement** across all projects.
