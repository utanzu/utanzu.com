Imagine sending a **secret message** to a friend. You don’t want anyone else to read it, so you decide to **scramble the words** using a secret pattern. Only your friend, who knows the pattern, can unscramble and read the message. This is exactly how encryption works!

### What is Encryption?

Encryption is a method of **`converting plain data into an unreadable format`** (ciphertext) so that only authorized users can access it.

### Types of Encryption

| Encryption Type           | Description                                                        | Example |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| **Symmetric Encryption**  | Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.                   | AES     |
| **Asymmetric Encryption** | Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. | RSA     |

#### **1. Symmetric Encryption (Fast but Requires Key Sharing)**

- A **single key** is used to encrypt and decrypt data.
- **Best for** encrypting large amounts of data quickly.

**Example: Encrypting with AES in Python**

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher = Fernet(key)

message = b"Sensitive Data"
encrypted = cipher.encrypt(message)
print(encrypted)

decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted)
print(decrypted.decode())
```

#### **2. Asymmetric Encryption (Secure but Slower)**

- Uses a **public key** to encrypt data and a **private key** to decrypt it.
- Used in **SSL/TLS encryption**, digital signatures, and secure email communication.

**Example: RSA Encryption Workflow**

1. The sender **encrypts a message** using the recipient’s **public key**.
2. The recipient **decrypts the message** using their **private key**.

```plaintext
[Sender] --(Encrypt with Public Key)--> [Ciphertext] --(Decrypt with Private Key)--> [Recipient]
```

### When to Use Encryption

- **Protecting stored passwords and credit card data.**
- **Securing communication over the internet (HTTPS, VPNs).**
- **Encrypting files and databases.**

Encryption ensures that **even if attackers steal data, they cannot read it without the decryption key**.
