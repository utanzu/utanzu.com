Imagine youâ€™re trying to enter a top-secret facility. At the gate, a security officer asks for **proof** that you belong there. Do you show an ID? Provide a fingerprint? Answer a secret question? The way you prove your identity in real life mirrors how authentication works in digital systems.

Authentication ensures that users are **who they claim to be** before they can access an application or service.

### Types of Authentication

Authentication can be classified into several methods, each with varying levels of security.

#### **1. Something You Know (Knowledge-Based Authentication)**

- **Passwords, PINs, and Security Questions**
- Simple but **prone to attacks** (brute force, phishing, dictionary attacks).

**Example:**  
A user logs into an email account by entering a password. If the password is weak (`password123`), it can be easily guessed.

#### **2. Something You Have (Possession-Based Authentication)**

- **One-Time Passwords (OTP), Smart Cards, and Security Tokens**
- Involves a physical or digital item **owned by the user**.

**Example:**  
A banking app sends a **one-time password (OTP)** to your phone before you can complete a transaction.

#### **3. Something You Are (Biometric Authentication)**

- **Fingerprint Scans, Facial Recognition, Retina Scans**
- Unique to each person and difficult to replicate.

**Example:**  
Unlocking your smartphone using **Face ID** or a **fingerprint scanner**.
