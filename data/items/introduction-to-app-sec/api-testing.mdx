Testing APIs for security vulnerabilities is a crucial step in application security. API testing ensures that endpoints behave as expected under different conditions and that they do not expose sensitive data or functions.

### Types of API Security Testing

#### **1. Authentication and Authorization Testing**

- Verify that only **authorized users** can access certain endpoints.
- Ensure API tokens and JWTs **expire and refresh correctly**.

```python
# Example: Testing API authentication with Python requests
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/protected"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer INVALID_TOKEN"}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.status_code)  # Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```

#### **2. Input Validation Testing**

- Send **malformed data** to check how the API handles it.
- Test against **SQL injection, XSS, and command injection**.

```python
# Example: SQL injection test payload
payload = {"username": "admin' --", "password": "password"}
response = requests.post("https://api.example.com/login", json=payload)
print(response.text)  # Should not return database errors
```

#### **3. Rate Limiting and Abuse Testing**

- Simulate **brute-force attacks** and excessive requests.
- Ensure APIs **block repeated failed login attempts**.

```python
# Example: Sending multiple login requests to test rate limiting
for _ in range(50):
    response = requests.post("https://api.example.com/login", json={"username": "test", "password": "wrong"})
    print(response.status_code)  # Expected: 429 Too Many Requests
```

#### **4. API Security Scanning**

- Use tools like **OWASP ZAP, Postman, and Burp Suite** to automate security testing.
- Run **fuzzing tests** to check for unexpected input handling.

By integrating security testing into API development, you can proactively fix vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.
