Penetration testing (or **ethical hacking**) is a security assessment technique used to **simulate real-world attacks** on applications, networks, and systems. The goal is to identify security weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.

### Why is Penetration Testing Important?

- **Identifies vulnerabilities** in applications before they are exploited.
- **Validates security controls** and ensures compliance with standards.
- **Helps organizations understand real-world threats** to their systems.

### Phases of a Penetration Test

| Phase                            | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Planning & Reconnaissance** | Gather information about the target system (domains, IPs, open ports). |
| **2. Scanning**                  | Identify potential entry points using tools like Nmap.                 |
| **3. Exploitation**              | Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to gain access.                     |
| **4. Post-Exploitation**         | Maintain access, escalate privileges, or extract sensitive data.       |
| **5. Reporting & Remediation**   | Document findings and recommend fixes.                                 |

### Example: Performing a Basic Network Scan with Nmap

```shell
# Scan a target for open ports and services
nmap -sV -A example.com
```

### Tools Used in Penetration Testing

| Tool           | Purpose                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Metasploit** | Exploitation framework           |
| **Burp Suite** | Web application security testing |
| **Wireshark**  | Network traffic analysis         |
| **Nmap**       | Port scanning and reconnaissance |

Penetration testing is an essential part of any security program, ensuring that vulnerabilities are **discovered and patched** before attackers can exploit them.
