Imagine publishing a book without proofreading—typos, errors, and inconsistencies would ruin it! The same principle applies to code. Code reviews **catch security flaws before they reach production**.

### Why Conduct Code Reviews?

- **Early Detection of Bugs**: Identify issues before deployment.
- **Security Improvements**: Catch vulnerabilities like **SQL injection** or **hardcoded credentials**.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Developers learn from each other’s mistakes.

### Effective Secure Code Review Process

| Step                           | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Set Code Review Goals**   | Define what to check (e.g., security, performance, maintainability). |
| **2. Use Automated Tools**     | Use linters and static analysis tools for faster reviews.            |
| **3. Perform Peer Reviews**    | Another developer examines the code for security flaws.              |
| **4. Document Issues & Fixes** | Track changes and provide constructive feedback.                     |
| **5. Re-test and Approve**     | Ensure fixes are properly implemented before merging.                |

### Common Security Issues Found in Code Reviews

- **Hardcoded credentials** in code (`password = "admin123"`).
- **Insecure API calls** (e.g., unencrypted HTTP requests).
- **Missing input validation** allowing **XSS and SQL injection**.
