Would you leave a **default password** like "admin123" on a new router? No! Secure defaults ensure that applications, systems, and devices start with **strong security settings**.

### Why Secure Defaults Matter

- **Prevents misconfigurations** that leave systems vulnerable.
- **Blocks common attack vectors** by enforcing best practices.
- **Simplifies security compliance** by applying safe settings from the start.

### Secure Default Configuration Practices

#### **1. Enforce Strong Default Passwords**

- Require **complex passwords** (at least 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
- Disable **default admin accounts** where possible.

```shell
# Change root password in Linux
passwd root
```

#### **2. Enable Secure Communication Protocols by Default**

- Disable **HTTP in favor of HTTPS**.
- Use **TLS 1.2+** instead of outdated SSL versions.

```shell
# Enforce HTTPS in Apache (Linux)
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

#### **3. Restrict Default Permissions**

- Use **least privilege principles** by setting minimal permissions.
- Deny **public access to critical resources**.

```shell
# Secure file permissions in Linux
chmod 600 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

#### **4. Enable Logging and Monitoring by Default**

- Enable **audit logging** for security events.
- Configure **log rotation** to prevent disk space exhaustion.

```shell
# View system logs in Linux
journalctl -xe
```

Secure defaults ensure that **new systems are not vulnerable from the start**, reducing security risks significantly.
