Mitigation strategies are security measures used to reduce the risk of threats exploiting vulnerabilities in an application.

### Key Mitigation Techniques

| Mitigation Strategy                      | Description                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **1. Least Privilege**                   | Grant users the minimum access required. |
| **2. Encryption**                        | Protect data in transit and at rest.     |
| **3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Adds an extra layer of authentication.   |
| **4. Input Validation**                  | Prevents injection attacks.              |
| **5. Security Patching**                 | Regular updates to fix vulnerabilities.  |

### Key Security Controls

#### **Secure Authentication and Authorization**

- Use **MFA** to reduce credential theft risks.
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to limit access.

#### **Data Encryption**

- Encrypt sensitive data using **AES-256** for storage.
- Use **TLS 1.2+** for secure communication.

#### **Input Validation and Secure Coding**

- Implement **parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection.
- Validate user input to block XSS attacks.

#### **Security Hardening**

- Disable unnecessary services and ports.
- Enforce strong security configurations.

#### **Continuous Monitoring and Incident Response**

- Deploy **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** to detect threats.
- Have a well-documented **Incident Response Plan** (IRP).

### Example: Mitigating a Threat in a Cloud Application

| Threat              | Vulnerability        | Mitigation Strategy            |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Unauthorized Access | Weak password policy | Enforce strong passwords & MFA |
| SQL Injection       | Unsecured queries    | Use prepared statements        |
| DDoS Attack         | No rate limiting     | Implement traffic throttling   |
