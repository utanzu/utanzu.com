Throughout this course, we've explored the fundamental principles of **Application Security** and how to integrate security into the development lifecycle. Let's review the key concepts covered:

### 1. **Application Security Basics**

- Understanding **why security is crucial** in modern applications.
- Identifying **common threats** such as injection attacks, data breaches, and misconfigurations.

### 2. **Core Security Principles**

| Principle                               | Description                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CIA Triad**                           | Ensures **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** of data.   |
| **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** | Users and systems should have only the **minimum access required**. |
| **Secure by Design**                    | Security should be **built into applications** from the start.      |

### 3. **Secure Development Practices**

- **Input validation & data sanitization** to prevent SQL injection and XSS.
- **Secure authentication & authorization** with MFA, OAuth, and RBAC.
- **API security best practices** to prevent abuse and data leaks.

### 4. **Testing and Security Assessment**

| Technique                  | Purpose                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Penetration Testing**    | Simulates attacks to identify vulnerabilities.           |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Uses automated tools to find weaknesses.                 |
| **Security Audits**        | Ensures compliance with security policies and standards. |

### 5. **Incident Response and Recovery**

- Having a **well-defined incident response plan (IRP)**.
- Performing **forensics analysis** after an attack.
- Conducting **post-incident reviews** to improve security posture.

This structured approach to security ensures **resilient and secure applications**, ready to face modern cybersecurity threats.
