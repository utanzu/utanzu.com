Imagine your bank account requires **just a password** to access. Now, what if a hacker **steals that password**? They’d have full control over your account. This is why **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is crucial—it adds extra layers of security.

### What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is a security system that requires users to provide **two or more verification factors** to gain access to an application.

### How MFA Works

MFA uses at least **two different types** of authentication factors:

1. **Something You Know** – Password, PIN, Security Questions.
2. **Something You Have** – Mobile device, security token, smart card.
3. **Something You Are** – Biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition).

### Types of MFA Implementations

#### **1. SMS and Email-Based OTPs**

- Users receive a **one-time password (OTP)** via SMS or email.
- **Common but vulnerable** to phishing and SIM-swapping attacks.

#### **2. Authentication Apps (TOTP-based MFA)**

- Apps like **Google Authenticator** and **Microsoft Authenticator** generate time-based OTPs.
- More secure than SMS OTPs.

#### **3. Biometric MFA**

- Uses **fingerprints, facial recognition, retina scans**.
- Found in **smartphones and secure banking apps**.

#### **4. Hardware Security Keys**

- **Physical USB security keys** (e.g., YubiKey, Titan Security Key).
- Highly secure as they **cannot be phished**.

### Example: Enabling MFA for a Cloud Service

A company **secures employee accounts** by enabling MFA:

1. Employees enter their **passwords**.
2. They receive a **one-time password (OTP) via an authentication app**.
3. After entering the OTP, they **gain access to their account**.

### Best Practices for MFA Implementation

- **Use authentication apps instead of SMS-based MFA**.
- **Enforce MFA for high-risk accounts** (admin accounts, financial transactions).
- **Combine MFA with adaptive authentication** (e.g., block logins from suspicious locations).
