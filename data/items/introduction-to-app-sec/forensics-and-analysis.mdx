After a security incident, digital forensics is used to **investigate the attack, determine its origin, and collect evidence** for remediation or legal action.

### Objectives of Forensics and Analysis

- **Identify how the attack occurred.**
- **Determine the extent of the compromise.**
- **Gather evidence for legal or regulatory compliance.**

### Digital Forensics Process

| Step                   | Description                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Data Collection** | Capture logs, memory, and disk images.           |
| **2. Examination**     | Analyze logs, file changes, and network traffic. |
| **3. Analysis**        | Identify attack techniques and impacted systems. |
| **4. Documentation**   | Generate forensic reports for remediation.       |

#### Example: Investigating a Data Breach

1. **Log Analysis**: Review system logs for unauthorized access attempts.
2. **Memory Forensics**: Extract running processes for malware detection.
3. **File Analysis**: Identify altered or exfiltrated files.
4. **Network Traffic Review**: Detect data transfers to suspicious IPs.

### Forensics Tools

| Tool           | Purpose                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Autopsy**    | File system forensics    |
| **Volatility** | Memory forensics         |
| **Wireshark**  | Network traffic analysis |
| **FTK Imager** | Disk imaging             |
