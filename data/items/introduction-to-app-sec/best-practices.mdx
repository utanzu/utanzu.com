To ensure security in SDLC, organizations should adopt the following best practices.

#### 1. **Shift Security Left**

- Integrate security early in the development process.
- Identify vulnerabilities **before** deployment.

#### 2. **Follow Secure Coding Guidelines**

- Use **input validation** to prevent injection attacks.
- Implement **proper error handling** to avoid information leaks.
- Encrypt sensitive data **at rest and in transit**.

#### 3. **Automate Security Testing**

- Use **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** to analyze source code.
- Perform **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** to detect runtime vulnerabilities.

#### 4. **Implement Secure DevOps (DevSecOps)**

- Automate security checks in CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitor applications using **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** tools.

#### 5. **Enforce Least Privilege and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Users should only have the minimum permissions required.
- Use **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for critical actions.

### Example: Applying Best Practices in an E-Commerce Platform

| Security Best Practice | Application |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Secure Input Validation** | Prevents SQL injection in search queries. |
| **Role-Based Access Control** | Restricts admin privileges to authorized personnel. |
| **Automated Security Scanning** | Detects vulnerabilities in checkout and payment APIs. |
| **Logging & Monitoring** | Tracks suspicious login attempts in real-time. |
