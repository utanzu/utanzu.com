Vulnerability scanning is an automated process that helps **identify known security weaknesses** in applications, networks, and systems.

### How is Vulnerability Scanning Different from Penetration Testing?

| Feature       | Vulnerability Scanning         | Penetration Testing                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**   | Identify known vulnerabilities | Exploit vulnerabilities like a real attacker |
| **Method**    | Automated scanning tools       | Manual and automated attack simulations      |
| **Frequency** | Regularly scheduled            | Performed periodically                       |
| **Impact**    | Low risk (read-only scans)     | Can cause system instability                 |

### Steps in a Vulnerability Scan

1. **Asset Discovery** – Identify systems, servers, and services.
2. **Scanning** – Use automated tools to detect weaknesses.
3. **Analysis** – Prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk.
4. **Reporting** – Generate reports for security teams to fix issues.

### Example: Running a Basic Scan with OpenVAS

```shell
# Start an OpenVAS vulnerability scan on a target system
openvas-start
```

### Popular Vulnerability Scanners

| Tool        | Type                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Nessus**  | Network & system vulnerabilities     |
| **OpenVAS** | Open-source vulnerability scanner    |
| **Qualys**  | Cloud-based vulnerability management |
| **Nikto**   | Web server vulnerability scanner     |

Regular vulnerability scanning **reduces the risk of cyberattacks** by identifying and addressing weaknesses before they can be exploited.
