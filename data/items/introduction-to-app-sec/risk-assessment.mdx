Risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing security risks to determine their potential impact on an application.

### Why Perform Risk Assessment?

- **Prioritizes Security Fixes**: Focus on critical vulnerabilities first.
- **Minimizes Financial Losses**: Reduces costs associated with breaches.
- **Ensures Compliance**: Meets industry standards like GDPR, PCI-DSS.

### Steps in Risk Assessment

| Step            | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **`Identify Assets`** | Determine what needs protection (e.g., databases, user credentials). |
| **`Analyze Threats`** | List potential threats that could affect assets. |
| **`Evaluate Vulnerabilities`** | Find weaknesses that threats can exploit. |
| **`Determine Impact`** | Assess how severe the consequences of an attack would be. |
| **`Calculate Risk Level`** | Use a risk matrix to categorize risks (High, Medium, Low). |

### Example: Risk Assessment for an E-commerce Website

- **Asset**: Customer payment data.
- **Threat**: Data breach via SQL injection.
- **Vulnerability**: Unsecured database queries.
- **Impact**: Financial losses, regulatory fines.
- **Risk Level**: High.
- **Mitigation**: Implement prepared statements and input validation.
