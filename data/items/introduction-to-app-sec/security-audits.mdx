A security audit is a **systematic review** of an organization's security policies, controls, and configurations to ensure compliance and identify risks.

### Why Conduct Security Audits?

- **Ensures compliance** with regulations like **ISO 27001, NIST, and PCI-DSS**.
- **Identifies misconfigurations** and security gaps.
- **Improves security posture** by enforcing best practices.

### Types of Security Audits

| Audit Type               | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Configuration Audit**  | Verifies secure system and network settings.                   |
| **Compliance Audit**     | Ensures adherence to industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). |
| **Code Audit**           | Reviews application source code for vulnerabilities.           |
| **Access Control Audit** | Assesses permissions and user access.                          |

### Steps in a Security Audit

1. **Define Scope** – Determine what systems and policies to review.
2. **Assess Controls** – Evaluate security configurations and permissions.
3. **Identify Gaps** – Document security weaknesses and risks.
4. **Recommend Fixes** – Provide actionable security improvements.
5. **Continuous Monitoring** – Regularly review and update security policies.

#### Example: Checking System Security with Lynis

```shell
# Run a security audit on a Linux system
lynis audit system
```
