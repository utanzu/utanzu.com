Have you ever left your front door open and walked away? That’s what leaving vulnerabilities in your code is like—an open invitation for attackers. Writing secure code is about **closing doors before hackers even try to enter**.

### Common Software Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Description | Example Attack |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **SQL Injection** | Injecting malicious SQL into database queries. | `' OR '1'='1' --` |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** | Injecting scripts into web pages viewed by users. | `<script>alert('hacked')</script>` |
| **Broken Authentication** | Weak login mechanisms allow unauthorized access. | Brute force attacks on weak passwords. |
| **Insecure Deserialization** | Manipulating serialized data to execute malicious code. | Tampering with JSON or XML payloads. |

### How to Avoid These Vulnerabilities

#### 1. **Sanitize Input and Use Parameterized Queries**

Never trust user input! Always sanitize and validate it before processing.

```python
# Bad (Vulnerable to SQL Injection)
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + user_input + "'")

# Good (Using Parameterized Queries)
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", (user_input,))
```

#### 2. **Escape and Validate User Input for XSS Prevention**

```html
<!-- Vulnerable to XSS -->
<p>Welcome, <?php echo $_GET["name"]; ?></p>

<!-- Secure Approach -->
<p>Welcome, <?php echo htmlspecialchars($_GET["name"], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); ?></p>
```

#### 3. **Enforce Strong Authentication**

- Require **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
- Enforce **strong password policies**.
- Implement **account lockout mechanisms** to prevent brute force attacks.
