Picture a vault where users enter a **PIN** to access their accounts. What if an attacker **entered a string that forces the vault to unlock for everyone**? This is what happens in **injection attacks**, where malicious inputs manipulate application logic.

### What Are Injection Attacks?

Injection attacks occur when an attacker **inserts malicious code** into an application, making it execute unintended commands.

#### **Types of Injection Attacks**

| Attack Type                    | Description                                                | Example                             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **SQL Injection (SQLi)**       | Attackers manipulate SQL queries to access or delete data. | `' OR '1'='1`                       |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** | Injecting JavaScript to steal user data.                   | `<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>` |
| **Command Injection**          | Running system commands via web input.                     | `; rm -rf /`                        |
| **LDAP Injection**             | Injecting malicious LDAP queries to bypass authentication. | `*)(uid=admin)(*`                   |

### How to Prevent Injection Attacks

#### **1. Use Parameterized Queries (Prevent SQLi)**

```python
# Vulnerable to SQL Injection
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + user_input + "'")

# Secure Approach: Parameterized Query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", (user_input,))
```

#### **2. Escape Special Characters (Prevent XSS)**

```html
<!-- Vulnerable to XSS -->
<p>Welcome, <?php echo $_GET["name"]; ?></p>

<!-- Secure Approach -->
<p>Welcome, <?php echo htmlspecialchars($_GET["name"], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); ?></p>
```

#### **3. Validate and Sanitize Inputs**

- **Restrict input length and type** to expected values.
- **Use allow lists** to filter valid inputs.

By enforcing these techniques, you can **eliminate vulnerabilities that attackers exploit** to compromise systems.
