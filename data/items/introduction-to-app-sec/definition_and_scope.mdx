`Application security`, often abbreviated as AppSec, refers to the measures and practices used to protect software applications from security threats. It encompasses security measures implemented at various stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC) to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and exploitation. It involves identifying, fixing, and preventing vulnerabilities in applications to ensure they are secure from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats.

### What is Application Security?

Application security involves securing applications from threats by incorporating protective measures throughout development, deployment, and maintenance.

#### Key Aspects of Application Security:

- **`Prevention`**: Implementing security measures to reduce vulnerabilities.
- **`Detection`**: Identifying security risks and vulnerabilities in applications.
- **`Response`**: Taking corrective actions to mitigate security threats.
- **`Recovery`**: Restoring applications and systems after an incident.

### Scope of Application Security

Application security spans various aspects, from secure coding practices to security testing and post-deployment monitoring.

| Area of Security                   | Description                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Secure Coding**                  | Writing code that minimizes vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflow. |
| **Authentication & Authorization** | Ensuring only legitimate users can access application resources.                          |
| **Encryption**                     | Protecting sensitive data during transmission and storage.                                |
| **Security Testing**               | Performing static and dynamic security testing to detect vulnerabilities.                 |
| **Incident Response**              | Having a strategy to respond to and recover from security breaches.                       |

Security should be a continuous process integrated at every stage of software development to protect applications from evolving threats.
