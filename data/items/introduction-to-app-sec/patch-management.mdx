Think of your smartphone. You get frequent software updates to fix security flaws and improve performance. In cybersecurity, **patch management** ensures systems and applications are **regularly updated to fix vulnerabilities**.

### What is Patch Management?

Patch management is the process of updating software, applications, and systems to fix security vulnerabilities and improve performance.

### Why is Patch Management Critical?

- **Reduces Attack Surface**: Prevents hackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities.
- **Ensures System Stability**: Fixes bugs and enhances performance.
- **Maintains Compliance**: Meets security standards (e.g., ISO 27001, PCI-DSS).

### Patch Management Process

| Step            | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Identify** | Track software versions and security patches.                |
| **2. Assess**   | Evaluate the risk and impact of missing patches.             |
| **3. Test**     | Apply patches in a controlled environment before deployment. |
| **4. Deploy**   | Implement patches in production systems.                     |
| **5. Monitor**  | Verify patch success and track new vulnerabilities.          |

### Best Practices for Effective Patch Management

#### **1. Automate Patch Deployment**

- Use tools like **WSUS, SCCM, or Ansible** to automate patch distribution.

#### **2. Prioritize Critical Patches**

- Apply **emergency patches** immediately to prevent exploits.
- Example: The **Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228)** required urgent patching.

#### **3. Test Before Deploying**

- Always test patches in a **staging environment** to avoid breaking systems.

#### **4. Keep an Inventory of Software and Systems**

- Maintain a **list of all applications** to track patch updates.

### Example: Patch Management in a Corporate Network

1. A security team identifies **Windows servers missing updates**.
2. They test the patches in a sandbox environment.
3. They deploy patches across production servers in a phased rollout.
4. They monitor systems to ensure the patches do not disrupt services.
