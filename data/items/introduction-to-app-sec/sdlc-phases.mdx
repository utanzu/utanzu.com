The **`Software Development Life Cycle` (SDLC)** is a structured process that guides the development of software applications. When security is integrated into each phase, it is known as the **Secure SDLC (SSDLC)**.

### Phases of SDLC

| Phase | Description | Security Considerations |
|--------|------------|------------------------|
| **1. `Planning`** | Define project scope, goals, and feasibility. | Identify security requirements early. |
| **2. `Requirements Analysis`** | Gather functional and non-functional requirements. | Include security controls and compliance needs. |
| **3. `Design`** | Create system architecture and detailed design. | Use threat modeling to detect potential risks. |
| **4. `Development`** | Write and test the application code. | Follow secure coding practices and conduct code reviews. |
| **5. `Testing`** | Validate that the software meets security and functional needs. | Perform security testing, such as penetration testing. |
| **6. `Deployment`** | Release the application to users. | Secure configurations, patch vulnerabilities. |
| **7. `Maintenance`** | Provide ongoing support and updates. | Continuous monitoring and incident response. |

### Example: Applying SDLC to a Web Application

- **Planning:** Identify user authentication as a key feature.
- **Requirements Analysis:** Include multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a security requirement.
- **Design:** Create a role-based access control (RBAC) model.
- **Development:** Implement secure authentication and encryption mechanisms.
- **Testing:** Conduct penetration testing on login and payment processes.
- **Deployment:** Set up monitoring tools and security logs.
- **Maintenance:** Regular patching and security audits.
