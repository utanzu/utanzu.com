Integrating security into the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** ensures that security is not an afterthought but a fundamental part of software development.

### Why Integrate Security?

- Prevents security vulnerabilities early 
- Reduces costs of fixing security flaws later 
- Ensures compliance with security regulations 
- Builds trust in software applications

### How to Integrate Security at Each SDLC Phase

| SDLC Phase | Security Activities |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Planning** | Define security policies and regulatory requirements. |
| **Requirements** | Specify security controls such as encryption and authentication. |
| **Design** | Conduct **threat modeling** and secure architecture reviews. |
| **Development** | Enforce **secure coding practices**, use static analysis tools. |
| **Testing** | Perform penetration testing, dynamic scanning, and security audits. |
| **Deployment** | Implement hardened configurations, use security monitoring tools. |
| **Maintenance** | Regular vulnerability assessments and patch management. |

### Example: Security Integration in a Mobile Banking App

- **Planning:** Identify data encryption as a key security requirement.
- **Design:** Use threat modeling to identify possible threats.
- **Development:** Write secure code following OWASP guidelines.
- **Testing:** Conduct penetration testing on the login system.
- **Deployment:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect attacks.
- **Maintenance:** Continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities.
