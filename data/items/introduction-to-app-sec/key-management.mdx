Encryption is **only as strong as how well you protect the keys**. If an attacker gets access to the encryption key, they can **decrypt everything**.

### Best Practices for Key Management

| Practice                  | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Use Strong Keys**       | Generate keys with at least 256-bit length for AES encryption.                 |
| **Store Keys Securely**   | Use **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)** or **Key Management Services (KMS)**. |
| **Rotate Keys Regularly** | Change keys periodically to reduce exposure risks.                             |
| **Limit Key Access**      | Restrict access using role-based access control (RBAC).                        |

#### **1. Secure Key Storage**

- **Never store encryption keys in source code.**
- Use **environment variables** or **secure key vaults**.

```python
import os

encryption_key = os.getenv("ENCRYPTION_KEY")  # Fetch key from a secure environment variable
```

### **2. Key Rotation**

Regularly update encryption keys to **mitigate risk**. Many cloud providers offer **automated key rotation**.

```shell
aws kms rotate-key --key-id alias/my-key
```

#### **3. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Key Management Services (KMS)**

- **HSMs**: Dedicated hardware devices for securely storing and managing keys.
- **KMS**: Cloud-based services like **AWS KMS**, **Azure Key Vault**, and **Google Cloud KMS**.

Proper key management ensures that even **if data is stolen, it remains encrypted and inaccessible**.
