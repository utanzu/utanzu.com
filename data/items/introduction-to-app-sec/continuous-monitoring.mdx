Continuous monitoring ensures that applications and infrastructure are **continuously observed** for security threats, misconfigurations, and compliance violations.

### Why Continuous Monitoring Matters

- **Detects security incidents in real-time.**
- **Identifies misconfigurations** before they lead to breaches.
- **Ensures compliance** with security policies.

### Components of Continuous Monitoring

| Component                                          | Purpose                                   | Example Tools                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Log Management**                                 | Collect and analyze system logs           | ELK Stack, Splunk              |
| **Intrusion Detection (IDS)**                      | Detect unauthorized activities            | Suricata, Snort                |
| **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**       | Monitor cloud security configurations     | AWS Security Hub, Prisma Cloud |
| **SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)** | Centralized threat detection and response | Splunk, IBM QRadar             |

#### Example: Setting Up Security Monitoring with ELK

```shell
# Install Filebeat to forward logs to ELK
sudo apt install filebeat
```

By integrating continuous monitoring into DevSecOps, teams can **detect and respond to threats before they cause harm**.
