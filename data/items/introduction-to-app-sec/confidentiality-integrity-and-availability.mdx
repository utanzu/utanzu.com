The CIA triad is the foundation of application security. It defines three essential principles every secure application should follow:

### Confidentiality

- Ensures sensitive data is accessed only by authorized users.
- `Example`: In an online banking app, encryption ensures your account details are only visible to you and the bank.

### Integrity

- Guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered during storage or transfer.
- `Example`: A file integrity check ensures that a document sent over email hasnâ€™t been tampered with in transit.

### Availability

- Ensures applications and data are accessible to authorized users whenever they need them.
- `Example`: A cloud service uses redundant servers to ensure users can access their data even during a hardware failure.

By adhering to these principles, we create secure and dependable applications that protect users and businesses.
