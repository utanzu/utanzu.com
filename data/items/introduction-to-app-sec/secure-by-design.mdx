### What is Secure by Design?

- Secure by Design means incorporating security measures into the software development process from the very beginning.
- The goal is to create applications that are secure from the ground up.

### Why is Secure by Design Important?

- `Proactive Security`: Addressing security early helps prevent vulnerabilities.
- `Cost-Effective`: Fixing issues during design is cheaper than after deployment.
- `User Trust`: Secure applications build user confidence.
