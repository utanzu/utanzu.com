Threat identification is a critical first step in application security. It helps developers and security professionals recognize potential risks that could exploit vulnerabilities in a system.

### What is a Threat?

A **`threat`** is any circumstance or event that could harm an application by exploiting weaknesses. It can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, system disruptions, or loss of integrity.

#### Common Types of Security Threats

| Threat Type                    | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Injection Attacks**          | Malicious code is injected into an application (e.g., SQL injection, command injection). |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** | Attackers inject scripts into web pages viewed by users.                                 |
| **Broken Authentication**      | Weak authentication mechanisms allow attackers to gain unauthorized access.              |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)**    | Overloading an application to make it unavailable to users.                              |
| **Zero-Day Exploits**          | Attacks targeting previously unknown vulnerabilities.                                    |

### Techniques for Identifying Threats

- **Attack Surface Analysis**: Mapping all possible entry points for attackers.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Using external sources to stay updated on emerging threats.
- **Red Teaming**: Ethical hackers simulate real-world attacks.
- **Threat Modeling Tools**: Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, OWASP Threat Dragon.

### Example: Identifying Threats in a Banking Application

Consider an online banking system:

- **Threat**: Unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Vulnerability**: Weak password policies.
- **Possible Exploit**: Brute force attacks.
- **Mitigation**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
