An **incident response plan (IRP)** is a structured approach for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents. A well-prepared plan ensures that organizations can **quickly contain threats**, **minimize damage**, and **restore operations** efficiently.

### Why an Incident Response Plan is Critical

- **Reduces downtime and financial losses.**
- **Ensures legal and regulatory compliance.**
- **Improves coordination between security teams.**

### The 6 Phases of Incident Response (NIST Framework)

| Phase                  | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Preparation**     | Establish incident response policies, tools, and communication protocols. |
| **2. Identification**  | Detect and confirm a security incident.                                   |
| **3. Containment**     | Limit the spread of the attack.                                           |
| **4. Eradication**     | Remove the threat and affected systems.                                   |
| **5. Recovery**        | Restore systems and resume normal operations.                             |
| **6. Lessons Learned** | Document findings and improve security practices.                         |

#### Example: Responding to a Ransomware Attack

1. **Detection**: Security tools alert the team to unusual file encryption.
2. **Containment**: Disconnect infected systems from the network.
3. **Eradication**: Identify and remove malicious software.
4. **Recovery**: Restore encrypted files from backups.
5. **Lessons Learned**: Improve email filtering and security awareness training.

### Incident Response Tools

| Tool                 | Purpose                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Splunk**           | Security event monitoring        |
| **AlienVault OSSIM** | Threat detection and response    |
| **TheHive**          | Incident response coordination   |
| **Cortex XSOAR**     | Automated security orchestration |
