Once an incident has been resolved, a **post-incident review (PIR)** is conducted to **evaluate the response, identify gaps, and improve security processes**.

### Why Post-Incident Reviews are Essential

- **Ensures continuous improvement** of security measures.
- **Prevents recurrence** of similar incidents.
- **Enhances incident response capabilities**.

### Key Steps in a Post-Incident Review

| Step                       | Description                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Incident Summary**    | Document what happened and when.                        |
| **2. Root Cause Analysis** | Identify how the incident occurred.                     |
| **3. Response Evaluation** | Assess the effectiveness of containment and mitigation. |
| **4. Lessons Learned**     | Determine what improvements can be made.                |
| **5. Action Plan**         | Define steps to prevent future incidents.               |

#### Example: Reviewing a Security Breach

1. **Incident Summary**: An attacker gained access through a **phishing email**.
2. **Root Cause**: Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled.
3. **Response Evaluation**: Containment was effective, but response time was slow.
4. **Lessons Learned**: Implement **MFA for all accounts** and conduct phishing awareness training.
5. **Action Plan**: Update security policies and improve monitoring.
