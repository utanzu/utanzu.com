Threat modeling is a proactive approach used in **secure AI development** to identify and mitigate potential risks before they are exploited by attackers. AI systems, particularly machine learning models, introduce unique attack surfaces that must be accounted for during the development phase.

### Why Threat Modeling Matters for AI

Traditional software security threats—such as SQL injection or buffer overflows—are well understood, but AI-specific risks include:

- **Model Inversion Attacks**: Attackers infer sensitive training data from the AI model's outputs.
- **Data Poisoning**: Malicious actors inject **corrupted data** into the training set, influencing model behavior.
- **Adversarial Attacks**: AI models are tricked into misclassifying inputs through carefully crafted perturbations.

### Key Steps in AI Threat Modeling

1. **Identify Assets**

   - AI model weights, training data, inference APIs, and user data.
   - What are attackers likely to target?

2. **Define Threat Actors**

   - Insiders, external hackers, or competing organizations.
   - What are their motives (e.g., financial gain, sabotage, surveillance)?

3. **Assess Attack Vectors**

   - How could an attacker manipulate the AI system?
   - Common attack surfaces include **data pipelines, model APIs, and storage environments**.

4. **Implement Mitigations**
   - Use **differential privacy** to protect training data.
   - Apply **robust adversarial training** to make the model resilient against attacks.
   - Use **model explainability tools** to detect bias and adversarial perturbations.

### Example: Threat Modeling an AI-Powered Chatbot

A **financial services company** is deploying an AI chatbot for customer inquiries. The team conducts a threat modeling session and identifies key risks:

| Threat                  | Description                                                           | Mitigation                                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Poisoning**      | Attackers inject fake customer queries to alter chatbot responses.    | Implement input validation and monitoring.      |
| **Adversarial Attacks** | Malicious inputs cause the AI to provide misleading financial advice. | Train the model with adversarial samples.       |
| **API Abuse**           | Unauthorized users send automated queries to overload the chatbot.    | Implement API rate-limiting and authentication. |

By incorporating **threat modeling early in development**, organizations can anticipate security risks and build more **robust AI systems**.
