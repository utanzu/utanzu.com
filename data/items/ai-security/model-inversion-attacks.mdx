### Introduction

**Model inversion attacks** allow attackers to **extract sensitive information** from an AI model, even if they do not have direct access to the training data.

#### **Scenario: Extracting Patient Data from a Medical AI**

A hospital uses an AI model to diagnose diseases based on **X-ray images**. Attackers **query the AI multiple times** and **reverse-engineer outputs** to reconstruct **images of real patients** used in training. This leads to a **severe privacy breach**.

### How Model Inversion Attacks Work

1. **An attacker queries the AI model** using specific inputs.
2. **The AI model returns outputs** based on patterns it learned.
3. **By analyzing multiple outputs**, attackers can reconstruct original training data.

| Attack Type                | Description                                                            | Example                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feature Reconstruction** | Attackers recover key features of training data.                       | Reconstructing faces from a facial recognition AI.               |
| **Membership Inference**   | Attackers determine whether a specific record was part of AI training. | Verifying if a celebrityâ€™s medical data was used in AI training. |
| **Attribute Inference**    | Predicting sensitive attributes of a person.                           | Extracting personal income details from an AI financial model.   |

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Limit Model Access**: Restrict public access to sensitive AI models.
- **Differential Privacy**: Add noise to AI outputs to **obfuscate original data**.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Prevent models from **memorizing** sensitive data.
- **Query Rate Limiting**: Restrict excessive queries to **prevent data reconstruction**.

### Key Takeaways

- **AI models can unintentionally reveal private information**, even when properly deployed.
- **Attackers can reconstruct training data** by analyzing AI outputs over multiple queries.
- **Data privacy techniques** such as **differential privacy** can **reduce risks**.
