AI is revolutionizing cybersecurity by **detecting threats faster**, **automating security operations**, and **improving defense strategies**. However, **attackers also use AI** to enhance cyber threats.

### How AI Enhances Cybersecurity

#### **Scenario 1: AI-Powered Threat Detection**

A **financial institution** faces thousands of login attempts daily. A **traditional rule-based security system** struggles to **identify fraudulent logins**.

- **Solution**: AI analyzes login behavior, detecting **unusual access patterns** and preventing unauthorized logins **in real-time**.
- **Example**: **Machine learning models** detect **brute-force attacks, insider threats, and credential stuffing attempts**.

#### **Scenario 2: AI in Malware Detection**

A **companyâ€™s antivirus software** relies on **static signatures**, missing **new malware strains**.

- **Solution**: AI-powered **behavioral analysis** identifies anomalies by detecting **unexpected system activity**.
- **Example**: AI detects **fileless malware and polymorphic viruses** that **evolve** to evade traditional security tools.

#### **Scenario 3: Automated Security Operations (AI in SOC)**

A Security Operations Center (SOC) **investigates thousands of security alerts daily**. **Human analysts struggle with alert fatigue**.

- **Solution**: AI-powered **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)** tools **automate triage, correlate threats, and prioritize alerts**.
- **Impact**: **Reduces response time** and **eliminates false positives**.
