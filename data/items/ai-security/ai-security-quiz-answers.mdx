Check your answers to see how well you understand **AI Security concepts**.

#### **1. Which of the following best describes an adversarial attack on an AI system?**

✅ **B. Manipulating an AI model’s inputs to force incorrect predictions**  
Adversarial attacks involve **subtly modifying inputs** to cause an AI model to misclassify data.

#### **2. Which security risk occurs when an attacker modifies training data to manipulate an AI model’s learning process?**

✅ **A. Model poisoning**  
Model poisoning happens when attackers inject **malicious data** to influence AI decision-making.

#### **3. In AI security, what is the purpose of differential privacy?**

✅ **C. To add noise to data, making it difficult to extract individual user details**  
Differential privacy ensures that **an individual’s data** cannot be inferred from AI model outputs.

#### **4. Which of the following is NOT a common AI attack surface?**

✅ **C. Application GUI**  
While AI models interact with application interfaces, **the GUI itself is not a primary AI attack vector**.

#### **5. A company’s AI chatbot starts providing biased responses to users. What could be the most likely cause?**

✅ **A. The chatbot's dataset was poisoned with biased data**  
Bias often originates from **flawed or manipulated training datasets**.

#### **6. Which AI security testing method simulates cyberattacks to assess AI model vulnerabilities?**

✅ **B. AI penetration testing**  
Penetration testing simulates attacks **to uncover weaknesses** in AI security.

#### **7. A hacker successfully reconstructs sensitive training data from an AI model’s outputs. What type of attack has occurred?**

✅ **B. Model inversion attack**  
Model inversion attacks allow **attackers to infer original training data** from an AI system’s responses.

#### **8. Which of the following is an example of AI-driven cybersecurity defense?**

✅ **A. AI-based anomaly detection in network traffic**  
AI is commonly used to **detect network anomalies** and **identify security threats**.

#### **9. Which security measure can help prevent adversarial input manipulation?**

✅ **A. Implementing adversarial training techniques**  
Adversarial training helps **AI models recognize and defend against adversarial inputs**.

#### **10. A bank uses AI for fraud detection, but hackers successfully fool the model by making slight modifications to fraudulent transactions. What type of attack is this?**

✅ **B. Adversarial attack**  
This is a classic **adversarial attack**, where attackers make small **input modifications** to mislead AI decision-making.
