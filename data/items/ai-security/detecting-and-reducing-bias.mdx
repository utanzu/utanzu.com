Once bias is present in an AI model, it must be **detected and mitigated** to ensure fair outcomes. Organizations need methods to evaluate AI fairness and apply bias-reducing techniques.

#### **Scenario: Racial Bias in Facial Recognition**

A research study found that some facial recognition systems misidentified people of color at significantly higher rates than white individuals. The reason? The training dataset contained a disproportionate number of lighter-skinned faces.

### Methods for Detecting Bias in AI

| Method                        | Description                                                   | Example                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Statistical Parity**        | Checks if AI decisions are equally distributed across groups. | An AI hiring tool should select men and women at similar rates.                                       |
| **Disparate Impact Analysis** | Identifies indirect discrimination in AI decisions.           | A loan approval AI assigns lower credit limits to minority applicants despite similar qualifications. |
| **Counterfactual Testing**    | Alters specific features to test AI fairness.                 | Changing an applicantâ€™s gender in a hiring AI and observing whether the outcome changes.              |
| **Explainability Techniques** | Tools like SHAP and LIME reveal how AI makes decisions.       | Explaining why an AI denied a mortgage application.                                                   |

### Strategies for Reducing AI Bias

1. **Diverse and Representative Training Data**

   - Ensure datasets include a wide range of demographics and real-world scenarios.
   - Use synthetic data to fill representation gaps.

2. **Bias-Aware Model Training**

   - Apply fairness constraints to prevent biased predictions.
   - Implement adversarial debiasing techniques.

3. **Post-Processing Fairness Adjustments**

   - Use re-ranking algorithms to adjust predictions after training.

4. **Human Oversight and Auditing**
   - Regular AI fairness audits ensure ongoing fairness.

### Key Takeaways

- AI bias detection methods help identify unfair AI decision-making.
- Diverse training data and fairness-aware models reduce bias.
- AI fairness should be **continuously monitored and audited**.
