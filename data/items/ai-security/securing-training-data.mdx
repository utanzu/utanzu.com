### Introduction

Training data is the foundation of any AI model. If the data is compromised, the model itself becomes **unreliable, biased, or even dangerous**. Ensuring the security of training data is **critical** to maintaining trust in AI systems.

### Why is Training Data Security Important?

#### **Scenario 1: Manipulating a Medical AI Model**

A healthcare AI is trained to detect **early-stage cancer** from X-ray images. Attackers **inject altered medical images** into the dataset, **misleading the model** into **misclassifying healthy patients as sick** and vice versa. This could lead to **incorrect diagnoses, putting lives at risk**.

#### **Scenario 2: A Fraudulent AI Hiring System**

A company uses an AI-powered hiring tool trained on **past hiring data**. Attackers **inject biased resumes** to **train the AI** into preferring **specific demographics** over others, creating **unethical hiring practices**.

### Best Practices for Securing Training Data

| Security Practice             | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Control**            | Restrict access to training datasets to prevent tampering.           |
| **Data Encryption**           | Encrypt datasets to prevent unauthorized access.                     |
| **Data Integrity Checks**     | Use hashing to verify data authenticity.                             |
| **Anomaly Detection**         | Detect suspicious patterns in the training data.                     |
| **Synthetic Data Generation** | Use **privacy-preserving synthetic data** instead of real user data. |

### Implementation Example: Data Integrity Check

```python
import hashlib

# Generate hash for training data file
def generate_hash(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        data = file.read()
        return hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()

# Check data integrity
original_hash = "e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03"
new_hash = generate_hash("training_data.csv")

if original_hash == new_hash:
    print("Data integrity verified!")
else:
    print("Warning: Data may have been tampered with!")
```

By **securing training data**, we ensure that AI models make **reliable and unbiased decisions**, reducing the risk of **manipulation and exploitation**.
