Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds **an extra layer of security** by requiring users to **verify their identity through multiple steps** before accessing AI systems.

#### **Scenario: Securing AI Model Access in Financial Institutions**

A bank allows employees to use an AI fraud detection system. To prevent **unauthorized access**, MFA requires users to provide:

1. **Password** (Something they know).
2. **One-time code from a mobile app** (Something they have).

### Common MFA Authentication Factors

| Factor Type            | Description                                       | Example                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Something You Know** | Passwords, PINs, security questions.              | Entering a banking password.     |
| **Something You Have** | Hardware tokens, mobile apps, smart cards.        | Google Authenticator or YubiKey. |
| **Something You Are**  | Biometrics like fingerprints, facial recognition. | Face ID or fingerprint scanning. |

### Implementing MFA in AI Systems

1. **Require users to authenticate with multiple factors** before accessing AI models.
2. **Use mobile-based MFA apps** (Google Authenticator, Authy, Duo Security).
3. **Restrict AI access from unauthorized locations or devices**.

### Key Takeaways

- **MFA significantly reduces AI system access risks**.
- **Biometric authentication** adds an extra layer of AI security.
- **Financial institutions and healthcare AI systems** must enforce MFA.
