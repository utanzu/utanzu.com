AI systems often handle **sensitive data and decisions**, requiring strict access control. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures that **only authorized users or systems** can access specific AI capabilities.

#### **Scenario: Preventing Unauthorized Access to an AI Medical Model**

A hospital deploys an AI-powered **diagnostic tool**. Without proper access control, **any employee** can submit medical data for analysis. By implementing **RBAC**, only **doctors and approved medical personnel** can use the system.

### How Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Works

RBAC assigns **different levels of access** based on user roles:

| Role               | Permissions                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**          | Full control over AI models, training data, and API endpoints. |
| **Data Scientist** | Can retrain models but cannot access sensitive data.           |
| **User**           | Can only query AI models but cannot modify them.               |

### Implementing RBAC for AI Access

1. **Define user roles and privileges** (e.g., Admin, AI User, Developer).
2. **Use authentication mechanisms** (OAuth, SSO, JWT) to verify user identity.
3. **Restrict access to sensitive AI features** based on user roles.

### Example: Role-Based Access Enforcement

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

user_roles = {
    "admin": ["train", "modify", "delete", "query"],
    "developer": ["train", "query"],
    "user": ["query"]
}

def check_permission(user_role, action):
    return action in user_roles.get(user_role, [])

@app.route('/access', methods=['POST'])
def access_control():
    data = request.json
    user_role = data["role"]
    action = data["action"]

    if check_permission(user_role, action):
        return jsonify({"status": "Access granted"})
    else:
        return jsonify({"status": "Access denied"}), 403

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Key Takeaways

- **RBAC prevents unauthorized access** to AI models and APIs.
- **Each user role has a specific set of permissions** to ensure AI security.
- **Enforcing access control in AI deployments** enhances **security and compliance**.
