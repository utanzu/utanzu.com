AI-powered applications introduce **new attack surfaces** that traditional cybersecurity practices **do not fully address**. Let’s explore how attackers exploit AI vulnerabilities.

### Key AI Security Threats

#### **Scenario 1: Data Poisoning Attack**

A **self-driving car** relies on an AI model trained on traffic sign images. Attackers **alter a few training images**, causing the AI to **misclassify stop signs as speed limit signs**.

- **Impact**: The AI makes **dangerous driving decisions**, posing a safety risk.
- **Prevention**: Use **secure datasets, anomaly detection, and adversarial training** to make AI models robust.

#### **Scenario 2: Adversarial Attacks**

A **facial recognition system** is deployed at an airport for passport verification. Attackers **wear specialized glasses with subtle patterns** that trick the AI into **misidentifying them as someone else**.

- **Impact**: Attackers bypass **identity verification**, leading to **potential security breaches**.
- **Prevention**: Use **defensive AI techniques** like **adversarial training** to detect manipulated inputs.

#### **Scenario 3: AI Model Theft**

A startup develops a **proprietary AI model** for detecting insider threats. **Hackers exploit an API vulnerability** to extract the model’s parameters and **replicate it for their own use**.

- **Impact**: Intellectual property theft **destroys competitive advantage**.
- **Prevention**: Encrypt model files, restrict API access, and use **model watermarking**.

### AI Attack Surface

| Attack Surface       | Description                                             | Example                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data**             | Poisoning, tampering, or exposing sensitive datasets.   | Modifying AI training data to introduce bias.               |
| **Model**            | Stealing, manipulating, or exploiting AI models.        | Extracting model weights from an exposed API.               |
| **Inference**        | Exploiting real-time AI decisions.                      | Fooling an AI system into making incorrect classifications. |
| **API & Deployment** | Attacking AI interfaces to leak data or alter behavior. | Exploiting a chatbot to extract private user data.          |

### How to Defend Against AI Attacks

1. **Secure AI Training Data** – Use **trusted sources and anomaly detection** to **prevent poisoning**.
2. **Defend Against Adversarial Inputs** – Train models with **adversarial examples** to **improve robustness**.
3. **Encrypt AI Models** – Use **obfuscation and access controls** to **prevent model theft**.
4. **Implement AI-Specific Monitoring** – Detect unusual behavior in **AI decision-making**.

Understanding **AI security threats** helps **anticipate attacks and build more resilient AI systems**.
