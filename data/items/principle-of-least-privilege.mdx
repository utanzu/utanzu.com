### What is the Principle of Least Privilege?

- The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) is a security practice that restricts access rights for users, accounts, and computing processes to the bare minimum permissions they need to perform their work1.
- This principle helps reduce the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of access rights.

### Why is the Principle of Least Privilege Important?

- `Minimizes Risk`: By limiting access, the potential impact of a security breach is reduced. If an account with limited privileges is compromised, the attacker has fewer opportunities to cause harm.
- `Enhances Security`: It helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and critical systems.
- `Improves Accountability`: With fewer privileges, it becomes easier to track and audit user actions, ensuring that only authorized activities are performed.
