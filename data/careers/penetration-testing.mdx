## Penetration Tester / Ethical Hacker

A `Penetration Tester`, also known as an `Ethical Hacker`, is responsible for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. Their goal is to find weaknesses before malicious hackers do, helping organizations strengthen their defenses.

## What Does a Penetration Tester Do?

Penetration Testers simulate cyberattacks to identify weaknesses in an organization’s IT infrastructure. They use a variety of tools and techniques to assess and exploit vulnerabilities in systems and applications.

Key responsibilities include:

- Conducting penetration tests on networks, web applications, and systems.
- Identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in infrastructure.
- Simulating real-world cyberattacks to test defenses.
- Writing detailed reports with findings and recommendations for remediation.
- Collaborating with security teams to patch vulnerabilities and improve security.
- Staying up-to-date with new hacking techniques and tools.

## Skills Needed to Be a Penetration Tester

Penetration Testing requires a mix of technical, analytical, and problem-solving skills. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. Technical Skills

- **Networking Knowledge**: Understanding of networking protocols like TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP.
- **Hacking Tools**: Proficiency with tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark, and Nmap.
- **Web Application Security**: Understanding web app vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- **Operating Systems**: Strong knowledge of Linux, Windows, and MacOS security configurations.
- **Cryptography**: Understanding encryption techniques and how to bypass them.
- **Exploit Development**: Ability to develop exploits to test security systems.

### 2. Analytical Skills

- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Ability to scan systems and identify potential weaknesses.
- **Risk Analysis**: Assessing the impact and severity of vulnerabilities found during tests.
- **Problem-Solving**: Coming up with creative solutions to bypass security measures.

### 3. Interpersonal Skills

- **Collaboration**: Working with security teams, developers, and IT admins to patch vulnerabilities.
- **Reporting**: Writing clear and detailed reports on testing results and suggested fixes.
- **Communication**: Explaining complex technical issues to non-technical stakeholders.
