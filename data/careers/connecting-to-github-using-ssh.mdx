## GitHub's SSH key fingerprints

When try to clone a Github repo using `SSH`, you might get an error like this:

```bash showLineNumbers
$ git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
Cloning into 'repo'...
The authenticity of host 'github.com (ip)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXU...ARLviKw6E5SY8.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

This is because you're missing the public key fingerprints,
the key can be used to validate a connection to Github remote server.

You can add the following ssh key entries to your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file to avoid manually verifying GitHub hosts.

```bash showLineNumbers
# Open the file in VSCode
$ code ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

Paste the following content to the file:

```txt showLineNumbers
github.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOMqqnkVzrm0SdG6UOoqKLsabgH5C9okWi0dh2l9GKJl

```

It's the default SSH key fingerprints from [Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints).

## Generating SSH key

Next you might get an error like this when trying to clone a repo:

```bash
Permission denied (publickey)
```

This is because you're missing the SSH key, you can generate a new one by following the steps below:

1. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<YOUR_EMAIL_ON_GITHUB>@gmail.com"
```

The system might ask you to enter a passphrase like this:

```bash showLineNumbers
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
```

<Twemoji emoji="warning" /> Type a simple one and don't forget it since you'll need it later.

2. Start the SSH agent:

```bash showLineNumbers
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid 59566
```

Then create the `~/.ssh/config` file (or update the existing one):

```bash
$ touch ~/.ssh/config # create the file if it doesn't exist
```

Add the following content to the file:

```txt showLineNumbers
Host github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Then add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain:

```bash
$ ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

3. Add the new SSH key to your GitHub account:

```bash showLineNumbers
# Copy the SSH key to the clipboard
$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Open your Github account and navigate to your **[SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)** page settings, then create a new SSH key.

Now you're good to go! Try to clone a Github repo using SSH to make sure everything is working.

Happy securing! <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />
